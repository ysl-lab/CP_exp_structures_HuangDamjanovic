# CP_exp_structures_HuangDamjanovic

This repository contains the crystal structure and NMR data of 53 cyclic peptide structures as reported in Table S2 and S3 of Huang et al (2021).

Structures were obtained from the Protein Databank and Cambridge Structureal Database. Files are formated as PDB files. A list of all structure codes, strutural datase, sequence, and length can be found in Huang_CPs.csv.  

Files are provided as-is with no guarentee of accuracy.
